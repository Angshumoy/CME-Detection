If you want to see the output only.

Follow these steps.

1. Create folder CME_Detect
2. Save CME_App.py in that folder
3. Save cactus_cme_filtered_new.csv in the same folder
4. Open swis_with_anomalies_and_matches_new.txt, then open the link. It will be a Google Sheets. Save it as a ".csv" file in the same folder
5. Now edit the CME_App.py code
  In the 7th and 8th lines of the file, use the path of the CSV files according to your path (the Path in which you saved those).
  To change the path, open the saved files. Right click and copy as path. And paste the path inside 
    df = pd.read_csv("C:\\Users\\....\\swis_with_anomalies_and_matches_new.cs", parse_dates=['time'])
    cme_df = pd.read_csv("C:\\Users\\....\\cactus_cme_filtered_new.csv", parse_dates=['datetime'])
    It should look like this. And remember to use double slashes(\\) instead of single slashes (\) where required.

6. Save changes. Open a New Terminal in VSCode.
7. Write "streamlit run CME_App.py" and enter. It will redirect you to your default browser. Choose dates on which you want to observe the CMEs.

If the above command doesn't work, use "python -m streamlit run CME_App.py" in the terminal.
